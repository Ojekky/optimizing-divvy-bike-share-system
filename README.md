## Rider Behavior & Station Utilization Analysis
 Problem Statement:
The Divvy bike-sharing system faces two key challenges:
	1. Uneven Station Utilization: Some stations experience high demand, leading to bike shortages, while others remain underutilized, causing inefficiencies in bike availability and redistribution.
	2. Member vs. Casual Rider Behavior: Understanding how subscribed members and casual riders use the system is crucial for improving pricing strategies, increasing memberships, and enhancing user experience.
Failing to address these issues can lead to poor service quality, reduced customer satisfaction, and inefficient resource management.
